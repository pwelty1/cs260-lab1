  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <div class="about">

    <p>   I am Peter Welty. I am a programmer and photographer.
  I currently study computer science at Brigham Young University. I created this website.
  Growing up, I had always done well in math and logic, but slowly gained an artistic perspective on my own. I had the hardest time reconciling both.
  Having the ability code, I have found the best of both worlds and bridged these parts of my mind.
I came to university to find myself and discover my personal interests.
It has been a long journey to find what I love and who I love. I actually found the
the love of my life at school. Here to the side is a lovely picture of my wife and I when we got married. She really is my best friend.</p>

  <p> One thing I have learned about myself and the world, is that we live in a world of paradoxes. Paradox is where we identify and create much of our own culture and art. Where ever there is tension in the mental, physical, or spiritual realms of our lives, we seek to express it.
  To understand me better, I want to share one of my own personal paradoxes. I am a pretty well-rounded person in general and interested in most things, yet I have a hard to becoming a master of one thing. Maybe you will be able see this in my work. </p>
